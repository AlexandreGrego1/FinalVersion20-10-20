## BARRIES TO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

As my limited knowledge in development tools, I have developed my portfolio in the same stands as my resume project lecture. Althought my limited knologment, I have applyied my own caracteristics to this project trying to give my particular caracteristics to the portfolio. 

After developed my first project, I noticed that I should spent more time absorving the theoric part of the lecture in order to have more subsides to apply the develop concets easily. 

I would save much more time if I had stopped to research about the theory before going to the next modulo.
