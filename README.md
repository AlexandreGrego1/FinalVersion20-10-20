## UX DESIGN / PRESENTATION

### Wireframing

## MOBILE WIREFRAMES

The layout placement and how they interact with one another goes through many stages, from conception to mockups to finalized UI is based on responsive view.


## TYPOGRAPHY

I have operated with mostly darker in the background and lighter colors in the font-family. The most dominant colors are black for background, white, cyan and for font-family.

Google Fonts CDN was used to have Sans-Serif and Exo as a font family for the body text.

## BARRIES TO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

As my limited knowledge in development tools, I have developed my portfolio in the same stands as my resume project lecture. Althought my limited knologment, I have applyied my own caracteristics to this project trying to give my particular caracteristics to the portfolio. 

After developed my first project, I noticed that I should spent more time absorving the theoric part of the lecture in order to have more subsides to apply the develop concets easily. 

I would save much more time if I had stopped to research about the theory before going to the next modulo.
