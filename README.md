# MILESTONE PROJECT - 1 
  
Personal Portfolio Alexandre Gregorio,

This portfolio aims to offer for potencial recruiters an on-line presentation of myself covering my work history, graduation, and my skills as a Web Developer.


## UX DESIGN / PRESENTATION

## HOME 

The home page consists of a profile picture, greetings, and a dedicated section to describe "Who I am".
A hamburger button is applied on the top-right of the page, and it is programmed to collapse the navigation buttons. 
Inside the footer section, there is a link with a printable version of my CV and my contact details.

The method applied to develop this page is described as per below: <br>

#### Header
- Section wrapped with a profile image and greetings;
- Zoom animation applied on a scale from 0.9 to 1.0 to call the user's attention;
- Hamburger button developed with a transform translateX (0) animation and collapsing the navigation buttons. Once the user clicks on the hamburger button, the navigation shows up, and the options are available to be clicked. <br>

## DOWNLOAD CV

Located on the footer section, the anchor link gives an option for recruiters to download the CV in pdf version. 

To keep the user on the main page, a "target_blank" attribute is applied to open the download page in a new tab.



### WIREFRAMES

The pages are developed and designed on their content at the structural level having commonly used layouts content and functionality which takes into account user needs and user journeys.

I have thought early in the project, in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.

### Mobile Wireframes

The layout placement and how they interact with one another goes through many stages, from conception to mockups to finalized UI is based on a responsive view.

## BARRIES TO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

As my lack of knowledge in development tools, I have developed my portfolio in the same stands according to my resume project lecture. 

Although my limited knowledge was a barrier, I have applied to this project the characteristics that in my opinion are similar to my profile. 

After developed my first project, I noticed that is required to spend more time on the theory lectures to have more understanding of the subjects to facilitate the development 
process in future projects. 


## CONCLUSION

This first project is crucial to keep me motivated to go throughout for the next modules on my course. 

As  I have got no idea what coding was before starting to study at Code Institute, I had several issues to develop this project and spending too much time sorting small problems
for being completely inexperienced. I have realized that I have to improve the way I was studying for the next modules.

Now I understand what our tutor Brian O Grady mean when he said "It is not a sprint, it is a marathon"
