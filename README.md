# MILESTONE PROJECT - 1 
  
Personal Portfolio Alexandre Gregorio,

This portfolio aims to offer for potencial recruiters an on-line presentation of myself covering my work history, graduation, and my skills as a Web Developer.


## UX DESIGN / PRESENTATION

### Wireframing

The pages are developed and designed on their content at the structural level having commonly used lay outs contect and functionality whick takes into account user needs and user journeys. 

I have thought early in the project, in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.


## HOME 

The home page consists of a profile picture, greetings, and a dedicated section to describe "Who I am".
A hamburger button is applied on the top-right of the page, and it is programmed to collapse the navigation buttons. 
Inside the footer section, there is a link with a printable version of my CV and my contact details.

The method applied to develop this page is described as per below: <br>

#### Header
- Section wrapped with a profile image and greetings;
- Zoom animation applied on a scale from 0.9 to 1.0 to call the user's attention;
- Hamburger button developed with a transform translateX (0) animation and collapsing the navigation buttons. Once the user clicks on the hamburger button, the navigation shows up, and the options are available to be clicked. <br>

#### Resume 
- Screen developed to split its size into two different layouts;
- Personal details takes 1/3 of the desktop view, while "about me" takes 2/3 of the desktop view. 
- Screens are responsive, when the page is opened on a small screen, the layout will float to the left, and text is aligned to the center page. The paragraphs are developed to display its context underneath each other as a column.

#### About Me
- Dedicated section to demonstrate to potencial recruiters about the candidate personality, what he/she has done, and what are their expections;
- A picture, and a resume text with "Who I am" context were wrapped in the same section.

#### Footer

- The target_ blank attribute is applied to keep the user on the main screen;
- Anchor links are applied to the professional network;
- Font awesome button is applied and it is hovering in red color.


## RESUME

The resume page consists of my work history and my skills as a developer student at Code Institute. 
Although my work history is from my background experiences, my front end and back end skills are copied from my resume project lecture at Code Institute.

The method applied to develop this page is described as per below: <br>

#### About Me

## DOWNLOAD CV

Located on the footer section, the anchor link gives an option for recruiters to download the CV in pdf version. 

To keep the user on the main page, a "target_blank" attribute is applied to open the download page in a new tab.


## MOBILE WIREFRAMES

The layout placement and how they interact with one another goes through many stages, from conception to mockups to finalized UI is based on a responsive view.


## TYPOGRAPHY

I have operated with mostly darker in the background and lighter colors for the font-family. 

The most dominant colors are: 
- Black for the background;
- White and cyan for the font-family.

Google Fonts CDN is applied, Sans-Serif and Exo are the main attributes for font-family and body text.

## BARRIES TO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

As my lack of knowledge in development tools, I have developed my portfolio in the same stands according to my resume project lecture. 

Although my limited knowledge was a barrier, I have applied to this project the characteristics that in my opinion are similar to my profile. 

After developed my first project, I noticed that is required to spend more time on the theory lectures to have more understanding of the subjects to facilitate the development process in future projects.
